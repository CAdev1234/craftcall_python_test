[![Python workflow](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/workflows/Python%20workflow/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Python+workflow%22)


[Selenium](https://selenium.dev) is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and
libraries enabling web browser automation. Selenium specifically
provides an infrastructure for the [W3C WebDriver specification](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/)
â€” a platform and language-neutral coding interface compatible with all
major web browsers.

The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who've
generously donated thousands of hours in code development and upkeep.
